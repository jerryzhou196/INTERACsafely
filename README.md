Subject: [URGENT] Company Financial Reports and Employee Salaries

Hey Team,

Hope you're all doing well! Attached is the spreadsheet with our confidential Q3 financial reports and the salaries of all our employees. Please review them before our Monday meeting.

You might not have access to the company portal right now, so I thought it's easier if I just email them to you.

Here's the password for the spreadsheet: Company123

Cheers,
[Your Name]
[Your Position] Company XYZ
